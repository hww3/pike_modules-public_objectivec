Version History

Version 0.1

- added add_backend_runloop() and remove_backend_runloop() to enable/disable the default NSRunLoop 
  to cycle when running in the Backend.
- added _isa() to dynamically generated classes, which should return the string name of the class.
- added Public.ObjectiveC.nil, which can be passed to Objective-C classes when you want to pass
  a nil value as an argument expecting an id (passing 0 or UNDEFINED will actually result in the
  integer value being converted to an NSNumber, which isn't usually the desired result).
- Public.ObjectiveC.purge_autorelease_pool() can be used to purge and recreate the global default
  NSAutoreleasePool object.
- First alpha release
