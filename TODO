- getting pike object variables from objective c
- setting pike object variables from objective c (works, but we assume 
    that everything is an object).
- getting objective c object variables from pike (this point and the next 
    rely on the new `->symbol() in Pike 7.7.
- setting objective c object variables from pike
- support for passing and returning pointers, structs and arrays from an 
    objective c call
- providing a way to overlay hand-coded functions on top of auto-generated 
    classes
- better conversion of pike_type to objective c encodings
- provide an easier way to bundle up applications (perhaps a stub 
    application that uses libpike?)
- integrate runloops and NSApplicationMain() with the pike backend
- wrappers for NSDictionary and NSArray so that we can access them more 
    easily from Pike.
- objective-c wrappers for mappings and arrays so that we can seamlessly 
    pass pike datatypes back and forth.
- support for kvo
